# OTT Weekly Pulse

Curated weekly movie & web series recommendations across Indian OTT platforms — Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, JioCinema, SonyLIV, ZEE5, Apple TV+ and more. Release weeks run strictly **Friday → next Thursday**, covering English, Hindi, and Marathi (including Hindi-dubbed titles).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives (shadcn-style), Lucide Icons, Embla Carousel
- **State/Data:** TanStack Query (server data), Zustand (watchlist, persisted to localStorage)
- **Backend:** Next.js Route Handlers (`src/app/api/**`)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma (`prisma/schema.prisma`) — designed for Supabase, but works with any Postgres instance
- **AI:** NVIDIA NIM (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`) for the "Quick AI Verdict" feature — same integration pattern as SatiCast / SanghaStatus

## Two ways to run this

### 1. Instant demo mode (no database needed)

The app ships with an in-memory data source (`src/lib/data-source.ts`) built from `src/data/mock-data.ts`, so it runs fully out of the box:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Weeks, filters, the release calendar, watchlist, and reviews all work — reviews/watchlist just live in server memory and reset on restart.

### 2. Full persistence with Postgres/Supabase

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in DATABASE_URL / DIRECT_URL from your Supabase project (or any Postgres)

npm install
npm run db:push     # create tables from prisma/schema.prisma
npm run db:seed     # seed 2 past weeks + current week + next week's preview
npm run dev
```

To wire the app to Postgres instead of the in-memory store, swap the function bodies in `src/lib/data-source.ts` for `prisma.title.findMany(...)` / `prisma.week.findMany(...)` calls — the returned shapes already match the Prisma models field-for-field, so this is a drop-in change. `src/lib/db.ts` already exports a ready-to-use Prisma client singleton.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example`. Key ones:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` | Postgres connection (Supabase pooled + direct URLs) |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | NVIDIA NIM API key — powers the "Quick AI Verdict" (falls back to a heuristic summary if unset, so the UI never breaks) |
| `NVIDIA_NIM_BASE_URL` | Defaults to `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` |
| `NVIDIA_NIM_MODEL` | Defaults to `meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | Optional — wire into `src/lib/data-source.ts` to pull real weekly releases instead of mock data |

```

## Automated data-fetching strategy (for production)

The seed script and mock data are meant to be replaced by a real weekly ingestion job. Two supported approaches:

1. **TMDB + JustWatch:** a scheduled job (cron / Vercel Cron / Supabase Edge Function) hits TMDB's `/discover/movie` and `/discover/tv` filtered to the current Friday–Thursday window and India region, cross-references JustWatch for platform availability, and upserts into the `Title` table.
2. **LLM-agent crawl:** a weekly job prompts an LLM (e.g. via the same NVIDIA NIM client in `src/lib/nvidia.ts`) with a structured-output request to summarize that week's confirmed OTT release slate from a curated set of entertainment-news sources, validated against a Zod schema before insert.

Either way, the ingestion job should also call `generateAiVerdict()` once per new title at insert time and persist `aiVerdictWatch` / `aiVerdictSkip`, so the live "Quick AI Verdict" card reads from the DB instantly instead of calling NIM on every page view (the current on-demand call + in-memory cache in `getOrGenerateVerdict()` is the demo-mode equivalent of that).

## Notes

- All sample titles, cast, and quotes in `mock-data.ts` are fictional placeholders standing in for real weekly releases.
- Poster/backdrop images use placeholder URLs (`picsum.photos`) — replace with TMDB image URLs (`image.tmdb.org`, already whitelisted in `next.config.js`) once wired to a real feed.
